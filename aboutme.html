    <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My name is Martin Wong. I am currently learning coding in a program called Code Nation. I, myself am simple, humerous, and lazy. I really value family, frineds, and life. On my spare time I like to go play sports or swim and play video games. I am trying to pursue an engineering major and get into a good college.</p>
<!--<p> I am currently 16. I was born on May 15 2002. I am currently attending Oakland Charter High School, which has a mascot of a matador. The major I'm trying to pursue is engineering. </p>-->
